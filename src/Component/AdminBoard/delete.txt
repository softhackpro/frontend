Like majority of followers of all religions they will justify issues in their text or beliefs but will never openly admits the faults in them.

Hinduism had started to deteriorate from 500 BCE onwards with the last 1500 - 2000 yrs being it's worst phase. The society was segregated by birth based caste and knowledge of the scriptures was only limited to a select few caste or people. As a result majority of hindus have not read their own scriptures and have been blindly following what they have been told to do. Example the bhagwat gita became famous only recently during the freedom struggle.

Similarly other social evils like sati pratha, restrictions on women like pardha, education etc., over obsession about purity of blood, isolation of widows, misuse of Deva dasi, restrictions on overseas travels and so on deteriorated the society as a whole.

Many texts were created and also the older ones modified to justify caste system as GOD mandated and also the possible consequences one would face if they went against them. Similarly women were also subjugated using these method.

Manusmriti is one such text along with other passages that you can find in Puranas as well. Eg skanda Purana.

I am not saying they are completely useless but foul play or definite issues in the society is clearly visible if you see from the modern lens in these texts.

Dr. Ambedkar being a lower caste himself, went through the struggles many lower caste faced then without reservation and also knew about the problems faced by women. So burning of manusmriti was his symbolic act of going against such beliefs that had gripped the nation and in direct confrontation with the upper castes who rigidly implemented them.
